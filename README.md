# Design and analysis of a 200 MWe lead-cooled SMR

In this project, my team and I designed a small reactor capable of producing 200 MWe fueled by UO~2~ and cooled by liquid lead. I was responsible for designing the reactor core and simulating it in SERPENT. I also calculated the following design variables to analyze the viability of the core design:

1. Reactivity swing of the reactor from 0 to 50 GWd/ton burnup: 533 pcm
2. Maximum control rod worth per assembly: -0.414$
3. Doppler coefficient: -1.040 pcm/k
4. Coolant temperature coefficient: +0.040 pcm/k
5. Axial expansion coefficient: -0.168 pcm/k
6. Radial diagrid expansion coefficient: -0.683 pcm/k

After that, my team also calculated the following salient features of the reactor from the safety and economic perspective:

1. Radioligical impact exclusion zone radius (based on a dose acceptance criterion of 20 mSv): 2.2 km
2. CAPEX (for an 8-unit setup): 8.4 billion USD
3. OPEX: 287 million USD
4. LCOE: 120 USD/MWh
